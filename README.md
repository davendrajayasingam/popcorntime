## Project: Popcorn Time

Create a web page that displays a list of movies that are now playing in theaters. Please include the movie title, release date, and cover image. The data should be retrieved from www.themoviedb.org API. The page should have the following features:

1. The list should be paginated, with 30 movies per page, most popular first.

2. The user should be able to filter the list by genres and ratings.

3. The user should be able to sort the list by movie title, release date, popularity or
ratings.

4. Clicking on a movie should display a modal window with more information about the
movie, including a synopsis, release date, and cast.

The page should be responsive and should look functionally decent on mobile and tablet screen sizes.
